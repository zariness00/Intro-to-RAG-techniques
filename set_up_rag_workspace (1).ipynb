Gatsby harbors a deep love for Daisy and is invested in keeping their interactions hidden from others, as evidenced by him not wanting Daisy to know about him asking others to invite her to tea. Further evidence of their romantic connection is seen in the intense and profound moment when Daisy tells Gatsby that she loves him, revealing the affection that exists between them. However, this also results in tension as Daisy's husband Tom is present, and visibly startled by this admission, implying a love triangle that complicates the relationship between Daisy and Gatsby. \n",

            "In F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel \"The Great Gatsby,\" Jay Gatsby's house is described as a colossal affair that is a classic example of the extravagant lifestyle in the 1920s. The mansion is situated in the village of West Egg on Long Island and it is described as a place of old wealth and sophistication. The house is depicted as having a Gothic style, furnished lavishly with period pieces, and even has a tower on one side. The estate boasts a vast lawn with gardens and is set right on the water, complete with its own private beach, a dock for his hydroplane, and a sparkling marina. Inside, the house is meticulously laid out with elegant rooms, including a grand ballroom where Gatsby holds his lavish parties. Despite the excellence and wealth illustrated by the house, it is an emblem of loneliness and a symbol of Gatsby's unfulfilled dream to win Daisy's love back.\n",
            "{'ids': [['The Great Gatsby_72', 'The Great Gatsby_4', 'The Great Gatsby_10']], 'embeddings': None, 'documents': [['. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,\\r\\nbut of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal\\r\\nscepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\\r\\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady\\r\\nexcitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and\\r\\nthe tired.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does she want to see Gatsby?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re\\r\\njust supposed to invite her to tea.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth\\r\\nStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.\\r\\nUnlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face\\r\\nfloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up\\r\\nthe girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth\\r\\nsmiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                                  V\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\\r\\nmy house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the\\r\\npeninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery\\r\\nand made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a\\r\\ncorner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\\r\\nitself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the\\r\\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in\\r\\nthe trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on\\r\\nagain as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned\\r\\naway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been\\r\\nglancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old\\r\\nsport', '. They are not perfect ovals—like the\\r\\negg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact\\r\\nend—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\\r\\nwonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\\r\\ninteresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular\\r\\nexcept shape and size.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though\\r\\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\\r\\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\\r\\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\\r\\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\\r\\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual\\r\\nimitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one\\r\\nside, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble\\r\\nswimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was\\r\\nGatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a\\r\\nmansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an\\r\\neyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I\\r\\nhad a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and\\r\\nthe consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a\\r\\nmonth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\\r\\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\\r\\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\\r\\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom\\r\\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\\r\\nChicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\\r\\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a\\r\\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\\r\\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of\\r\\nanticlimax', '. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\\r\\nback at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\\r\\ndiscontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\\r\\npicture of her, somewhere before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody\\r\\nthere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know a single—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must know Gatsby.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\\r\\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\\r\\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\\r\\nyoung women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\\r\\nthe sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\\r\\ndiminished wind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\\r\\nfingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She\\r\\nlooked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day\\r\\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\\r\\nthe year and then miss it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\\r\\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me\\r\\nhelplessly: “What do people plan?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\\r\\nlittle finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,\\r\\nbut you did do it']], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[{'author': 'F.

            "In \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gatsby's mansion is located in West Egg on Long Island, and its grandeur encapsulates his immense wealth and his desire to flaunt it. The house is an \"imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy\" with a tower on one side, a thin layer of raw ivy implying its newness, a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. This demonstrates Gatsby's opulence and his ambition to impress the high society. Inside, the mansion comprises a library filled with actual books indicating Gatsby's strive to portray himself as traditionally educated and refined. His house, therefore, is a symbol of his aspirations, illusions, and ultimately, his catastrophes. The visitors to Gatsby's house during a particular summer include people from both West and East Egg, signifying acceptance and recognition of his status from high society, despite their knowing little about him. - [Source: The Great Gatsby, F.

            "A: In the storyline of \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Daisy and Tom Buchanan are married, but Daisy and Gatsby share a romantic connection. This creates a complex love triangle. In a particular scene, Daisy openly tells Gatsby that she loves him, while her husband Tom is present. This revelation astounds Tom. The tension between the three characters grows as Tom observes the undeniable chemistry between his wife and Gatsby. [Source: The Great Gatsby, F.

            "Q: What are the key events that led to Daisy's decision to marry Tom?\n",
            "A: Daisy's decision to marry Tom Buchanan followed a series of events. After presumably being prevented from going to New York to say goodbye to a soldier going overseas, Daisy stopped mingling with soldiers and began interacting with a group of men in town. She later attended a debut after the armistice. In February, she was seemingly engaged to a man from New Orleans. Nonetheless, in June, she married Tom Buchanan, a man from Chicago. The event was grandiose, with Tom bringing a hundred people in four private cars and renting an entire floor of the Muhlbach Hotel. Tom gifted Daisy a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars the day before their wedding - [Source: The Great Gatsby, F.

            "Q: What role do societal expectations and norms play in Daisy's decision to marry Tom?\n",
            "A: Daisy's decision to marry Tom Buchanan appears to be largely influenced by societal norms and expectations rather than personal affection. Prior to her marriage, Daisy was rumored to be infatuated with a soldier, but her family effectively stopped her from pursuing him. Instead, Daisy had to confine her relationships to those men who couldn't make it into the military, suggesting that societal pressure to associate with individuals of particular status played a significant role in her choice of suitors. The grandiosity of her marriage to Tom, including the extravagant gift of pearls and the remarkable pomp and circumstance, affirms the importance of wealth and social standing in Daisy's decision to marry him. Indeed, despite apparent second thoughts on her wedding day, Daisy seems to conform to societal standards rather than following her personal desires.\n",
